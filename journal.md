# Title
Simulations of biomass burning aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
We acknowledge the ground breaking work of Allen et al but they 
have not answered the question of the secondary particle formation. 

Allen et al describe the Aerosol Mass Spectrometer in their 2004 paper.

Joe Bloggs et al have also made measurements in this region. 

# Simulations
John's awesome model simulates our measurements to gain useful 
insight into particle formation process.
